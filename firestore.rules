/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user account data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is stored under the /users/{userId} path, ensuring that each user's data is isolated and protected.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own data. Listing all users is disallowed.
 * - The /users/{userId} collection enforces strict ownership based on the authenticated user's ID.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'id' field within each UserAccount document is used to enforce ownership.
